# CS-305-Software-Security
Artemis Financial is a financial service company that develops investment and retirement plans for its clients. Because of financial data's sensitive nature, the company needed to ensure taht its software was secure and compliant with industry and international regualtions. The issue Artemis Financial wanted to address was identifying vulnerabilities in its code and dependencies so that the application could support secure communications and maintain compliance with financial data protection standards.
One thing I did well during the vulnerability assessment was manually reviewing the code for input validation and encryption issues. I was able to clearly point out where user input was being accepting without validation and where encryption was missing, which are both critical risks in a financial system. Coding securely is important because it prevents attackers from exploiting weaknesses that could compromise sensitive data. Strong security adds value to a company by protecting customer trust, ensuring compliance, and reducing the risk of costly data breaches.
The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was reviewing the large list of dependency vulnerabilities. It required understanding not just the names of the libraries but also the kinds of risks they introduced. On the other hand, the namual review of the code was helpful because it allowed me to connect the vulnerabilities directly to the company's business needs, such as ensuring encryption for compliance.
I increased layers of security by recommending strong input validation, secure API desing, encryption for sensitive data, standardized error handling, and updating outdated libraries. In the future, I would continure to use both manual code reviews and automated tools such as dependency check reports or static code analysis to assess vulnerabilities. I would then prioritize mitigation techniques based on the severity of risks and the potential impact on sensitive financial data.
To make sure the code remained functional and secure, I reviewed how changes would impact both the application's operation and its compiance requirements. After refactoring, I would rerun automated staic tests and perform manual testing to verify that no new vulnerabilities were introduced during updates. Using these methods helps ensure both security and functionality are maintained.
I used dependency check tools, vulnerability reports, and secure coding practices like input validation and error handling. These resources will continue to be useful in future projects because they provide a structured approach to finding and addressing security risks before deployment.
From this assignment, I could show future employers my ability to perform a structured vulnerability assessment, identify both code level and dependency level issues, and create a clear mitigation plan. This demonstrates not only technical knowledge but also my ability to connect security practices to business needs, which is valuable in any software development or cybersecurity role.
